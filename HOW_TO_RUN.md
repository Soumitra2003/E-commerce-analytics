# How to Run the E-Commerce Analytics Capstone Project

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the complete analytics project.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd "c:\data analytics\ecommerce-analytics-capstone"

# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ecommerce-analytics

# Or use pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run the Analysis
```bash
# Start Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook notebooks/

# Run notebooks in order:
# 1. 01_data_collection.ipynb - Generate and explore data
# 2. 02_eda.ipynb - Exploratory data analysis  
# 3. 03_feature_engineering.ipynb - Customer segmentation
# 4. 04_modeling.ipynb - Machine learning models
# 5. 05_business_insights.ipynb - Final recommendations
```

### Step 3: Create Power BI Dashboard
```bash
# Prepare data for Power BI
cd dashboard
python powerbi_data_prep.py

# Then open Power BI Desktop and import the CSV files
# Follow the instructions in dashboard/README.md
```
